<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Anabelle. I am new in the dev industry. Trying my best to learn anything there is to learn. My project is to become a PM.
  I used to work as one, but in the localization industry (at TransPerfect). My studies did focus on languages, economics and law. 
  During my master's degree, I learned about scientific and technical translation, as much as project management. That was my favorite part.
</p>

<p>After my graduation, I work as a full-time PM for TransPerfect for a year and a half. I relocated in Rennes (Brittany, France). And Rennes is known for its IT firms.
  I am planning to go back to uni maybe, and try to become a Project Manager, a Product Owner or a Scrum Manager. 
  Currently following an Udemy bootcamp. This is the final project for the HTML module.

<p>I am supposed to write a new paragraph but I don't really know what to say for know. Maybe I should have left the latin here. 
  I used to be really good at latin. Anyway.
  See you soon for a better website !
